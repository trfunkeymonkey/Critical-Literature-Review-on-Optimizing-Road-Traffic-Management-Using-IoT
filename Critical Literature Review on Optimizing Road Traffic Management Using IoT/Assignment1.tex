\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Background:}\\
    City planners and officials globally are placing more emphasis on managing traffic flow due to rapid urbanization and population growth. Conventional traffic control systems are struggling to keep pace with the demands of today's transportation dynamics as vehicle densities continue to rise. The issue of traffic congestion in has been getting more severe.\\

Traffic lights are implemented in urban areas to alleviate traffic congestion and reduce the risk of accidents. The traffic signal's reference variable stays the same and is consistent across all roads. Resource waste happens due to the complicated traffic conditions on both lanes of the road. As the quantity of roads and vehicles continues to grow, it will become increasingly difficult to sustain an effective traffic and transportation system. Therefore, if a road is vacant, the traffic signal for that pathway ends up being inefficient because the regular traffic management system is unable to detect any vehicles on that road. Dealing with traffic and congestion is not feasible given the current standard car management system. Cities are looking for a better alternative. (S. C, S. Radhika, M. K, S. Ranjith, and N. Sasirekha, "An intelligent IoT Enabled Traffic queue handling System Using Machine Learning Algorithm," 2022)\\

Recurrent disturbances, such as traffic congestion, will affect transportation efficiency. At the same time, traffic congestion will lead to more traffic accidents and increased fuel consumption and environmental pollution. This necessitates new strategies to enhance transportation efficiency and safety. The IoT can provide a solution through the ability to monitor and control traffic in real-time, resulting in better traffic management and lower energy usage. IoT systems combine different sensors, communication networks, and data analytics to improve traffic flow and energy efficiency.\\
\\

    \item \textbf{Research Problem/Question:}\\
    How can road traffic management be improved with the help of IoT-based technology that also has great energy efficiency?\\

Traditional traffic light systems having trouble to adapt to nowadays urban traffic because of reliance on fixed schedules and did not take account of real-time traffic. It leads to poor traffic flow and increased energy consumption. (Smart Signalling: A Smart Internet of Things Assisted Traffic Light Controlling and Monitoring System Using Intelligent Sensors)

Even though street lighting system already advance with IoT for adaptive control and energy efficiency (Energy Efficient Smart Street Lighting System), progress in IoT-based traffic light management systems remains stagnant. Current IoT-based traffic management approaches that use real-time data and machine learning, show potential in improving traffic queue management and overall system performance (An Intelligent IoT Enabled Traffic Queue Handling System Using Machine Learning Algorithm; IoT-Enabled Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Control Management for Intelligent Transportation Systems).\\

\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Evaluation of the Literature:}\\
    The findings from the Smart IoT-Assisted Traffic Light Control System prove how effective real-time adaptive signal control can be for improving traffic flow and cutting down congestion. By adjusting traffic signals based on current conditions, this system boosts vehicle throughput and reduces delays. Similarly, the Machine Learning-Based Traffic Queue Handling System shows the benefits of using predictive analytics and anomaly detection for better traffic management. The significant energy savings from smart street lighting systems highlight how intelligent infrastructure can enhance traffic management by improving visibility and cutting down on energy waste. While in Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Control Management, through real-time data and dynamic control, traffic congestion can be greatly reduced, and the three-layer architecture ensures robust data collection and efficient communication.  
    
    \item \textbf{Gaps in Research:}\\
    
    Although there are a number of studies done, most of them are on a small scale, and it leads to questions like how it would be for larger scale implementation like city-wide or across nation highway traffic. Concerning energy efficiency was also one of the gaps, since there are only several studies done, and some of them also focus on street lighting and not on integrating energy-efficient technologies with broader traffic management systems. And another critical gap that is worth mentioning is interoperability and standardization. This mainly concerns the fact that most of the cities already have their legacy traffic management systems in place, and integrating new IoT-based solutions with these systems would be a challenge.  
    
    \item \textbf{Implications for Future Research:}\\
    
    Based on the trend and gaps that have been found, few implications for future research can be concluded. Future research will be dealing with the increased complexity of city-wide traffic, managing a higher amount of data, and ensuring excellent coordination across multiple traffic and cities. Hence, scalability is one of the implications. As we approach more and more toward smart cities, interdisciplinary integration would be a thing. The need for collaboration between other urban infrastructures, such as energy grids and smart lighting, would improve efficiency and sustainability. Lastly, the optimization of energy efficiency has to be mentioned because, as the scale would be larger, real-time energy consumption of traffic signals should be monitored and help in analyzing data to reduce overall urban energy use.
